## Description

This is a simple drumkit made in vanilla JavaScript. The instructions are pretty complex, so play close attention:

1. Load up the page.
2. Press one of the clearly labeled keyes to play the corresponding drum sounds.
3. Jam out wildly, even if (and especially if) you're in a public place.

Rock on!
